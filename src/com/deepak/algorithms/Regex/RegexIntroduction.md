# Regex Introduction

Regex is a sequence of characters that helps us to find a string or set of strings. Java provides java.util.regex package for pattern matching with regular expressions.
There are 3 classes in this package,

1. Pattern class - invoke compile() method alongwith the regex as param. This returns a pattern back.
2. Matcher class - It interprets the pattern and matches it with given input.
3. PatternSyntaxException class - Will be invoked if there exists a error in pattern.

Capturing groups - 
way to treat multiple characters as one single unit. Capturing groups are counted by number of open paranthesis
in the regex.
